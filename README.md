##**Sortify**

Sortify is an engaging tool built using C++ and the SDL2 library, offering a graphical representation of various sorting algorithms. This project provides an interactive way to understand and compare the functioning of popular sorting techniques.

Sorting algorithms are essential in computer science, used to arrange data in a particular orderâ€”usually ascending or descending. While numerous algorithms exist, this application focuses on a select few, showcasing their unique behaviors through animations.

The algorithms included are:

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Bubble Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Heap Sort

Key features include:

A fixed list size of 130 elements.

The ability to randomize the list.

Ascending order sorting for all algorithms.

Note: For better visualization, faster algorithms like Merge Sort are intentionally slowed down to align with the animation speed of others. The displayed sorting durations do not precisely reflect their theoretical time complexities.

**Getting Started**

Option 1: Run the Precompiled Application

Download the latest release of the application.

Execute the file: SortingVisualizer.exe.

Download the latest release

Option 2: Build from Source

Clone the repository to your system.

Install the SDL2 library:

Follow this SDL2 setup guide.

Ensure you use the 64-bit version of SDL2 by replacing i686-w64-mingw32 with x86_64-w64-mingw32 as needed.

Add SortingVisualizer.cpp from the repository to your project.

Configure your build settings using the guidelines from the SDL2 tutorial and compile the application.

**Usage**

Controls:

0: Generate a new randomized list.

1: Run Selection Sort.

2: Run Insertion Sort.

3: Run Bubble Sort.

4: Run Merge Sort.

5: Run Quick Sort.

6: Run Heap Sort.

q: Quit the application.

Note: Allow the current sorting operation to complete before issuing new commands to avoid unexpected behavior.

**Why Use Sortify?**

Learn By Watching: Understand sorting algorithms intuitively through animations.

Interactive Experience: Randomize datasets and experiment with different algorithms.

Educational Tool: Ideal for students, educators, and anyone curious about algorithmic behavior.
